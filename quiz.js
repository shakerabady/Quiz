Q2:
Write a function called countDown
that takes one parameter
and return a string represent the count down from the number
that insert to 0
instead of 0 need to ahve "done"
between each number a comma and space
** you need to use recursion

countDown(5)

countDown(2)
=> "2, 1, done"

countDown(7)
=> "7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, done"
